            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS Man is a reaſonable creature, ſo is ſpeech given to him by God to expreſs his reaſon, and a tongue to utter that expreſſion: Brute creatures can make a noiſe, but man only can articulate his voice; his mind provideth the matter, his breath the convoy, and his tongue frameth diſtinct and ſignificant words and ſyllables, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth the ſenſe of our minds from us by the ear to the heart of others: The Tongue is the ſecretary of the mind, and the Interpreter of the heart; it is the great huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter by which we negotiate and traffique one

And to ſmite on the cheek-bone, and break out the teeth,</hi> ſaith <hi>Druſius,</hi> ſignifieth in a proverbial ſpeech, a puniſhment joyned with reproach and infamy. The Tongue hath no Rein by nature, but hangeth looſe in the midſt of the mouth, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that hollow place as its appointed limits for the nimbleneſs thereof.

            <p>The Tongue in Scripture is called <hi>Mans Glory;</hi> but alas! fooliſh man turneth his glory unto ſhame; he hath no member more fit to honour God, and edify his Neighbour; and none whereby God is more diſhonoured, and Mankind more injured: Moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when Gentlemen meet, they talk of their Hawks and Hounds, their Feaſts and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetings, their pleaſures, ſports, and paſtimes; when Gentlewomen meet, they talk of their Attires and Habits, new faſhions and new fangles: when Husbandmen meet, their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is how the year will fall out, what the price of Corn and Cattle is: Neighbours can meet together to conferre about Town-buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but God is quite forgotten,<note place="margin">Clara cum laude la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Phyſitians take great notice of the tongue, judging thereby of the health or ſickneſs of the body: ſo our words ſhew plainly the qualily of our ſouls; and as a veſſel is known by the ſound, whether it be whole or broken; ſo are men proved by their ſpeech, whether they be ſound or rotten at heart: Holy tongues are alwayes deſirous to be ſpeaking good, to ſpeak of Gods name, which to do, is truly to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy it,<note place="margin">Polan. Syntag. cap. 10. <hi>de lege.</hi>
               </note> ſaith <hi>Polanus:</hi> This is the practice of the glorified Saints, and muſt be ours: A Father takes moſt delight, in his child, when it can talk of him, and with him; ſo God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to hear us praiſing him, and making him our ſong: And as the Bees mingle no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their little mouths but honey; ſo ſhould our tongues be alwayes honied with the love of God, and to feel no pleaſant ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but to hear the praiſes of God paſs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row our mouths, with ſo daily thankfulneſs for all our bleſsings, that ſome honey-dew may paſs into the hearts of the hearers. 'Tis
<pb facs="tcp:61756:4"/> good to ſpeak of God reverently, not to ſhew our own eloquence; but with a ſpirit of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to diſtil the precious balm of true devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſometime into the ears of one, ſometime of another, which muſt be done ſweetly by way of inſpiration; for marvellous it is, how much a ſweet and amiable perſwaſion to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good, is of force to attract the hearts of men unto it. Words are not to be affected by us for curioſity or vain glory: to what end ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is a golden key, if it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen not what we deſire? and what hurt if the key be of wood, ſo it do the deed which the other cannot? ſeeing all that we expect from a key, is but to open what before was ſhut up: therefore all painted and gawdy words muſt be avoided, that edify not. A good man had rather his words go forth in a plain dreſs, then in the garb of an Harlot. But albeit our words are to be without vain affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet Rhetorical and Hyperbolical expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are ſometime uſeful and excellent: ſuch ſpeeches as are according to the rules of Art, which are laid down in Rhetorique, which delivereth rules of elegant ſpeech; and what is according to Art, muſt needs be lawful, uſeful, and commendable. <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe the Arts are gathered out of the creatures by the wiſdom of God which is in the creatures, or from the divers actions and affections of the
<pb facs="tcp:61756:5"/> creatures, working according to the ſevera ends they are directed unto; which ends are good, as may appear by the examination of particular Arts, as Logick, natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, Aſtronomy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This elegant kind of ſpeaking God hath given to ſome men more then others, according to the wiſdom and paſſionateneſs of affection beſtowed on them; indeed this kind of ſpeech is the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of all other; and we ſhall obſerve that the moſt lofty writings of the Scriptures are written in this ſtile; as the book of the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> is a continual Allegory; and why was <hi>David</hi> called <hi>the ſwee-ſinger of Iſrael?</hi> was it not for that the Pſalms of all other Scriptures are moſt full of Metaphors, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories, Hyperbolies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Songs that are in Scripture, and the Books of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets do abound with theſe figurative ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>2,</hi> Becauſe the Arts do not contradict each other; for what is true in one Art is not falſifyed by another Art; and what is true in Logick, Grammar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not falſe in Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick or Theology. <hi>3.</hi> All Arts are ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to Divinty; She is the Miſtriſs, the reſt are the handmaids; therefore this is to be noted, that we are not alwayes bound to ſtrict propriety of ſpeech, but have liberty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us out of the word of God to adorn our ſpeeches with figurative ſentences: He is
<pb facs="tcp:61756:5"/> rightly eloquent ſaith <hi>Cicero,</hi> who obſerving a <hi>decorum,</hi> and tempering his ſtile according to his perſon, can ſpeak fitly, fully and fluent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all things, temperately of mean things, and weightily of matters of importance.</p>
            <p>As for prolixity and ſhortneſs of ſpeech, either may be uſed commendably in their time; as Mariners ſometime ſail with large ſpread, and ſometime with narrower gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſails: we ſhould affect rather to be great doers then great ſpeakers: It is ſaid of our Saviour, he began firſt to do, and after to teach. <hi>Act. 1.1.</hi>

                  <hi>Didac.</hi> Stell. de contemp. mundi.</note> It is a monſtrous thing for a man to have his tongue larger then his hand. God hath made the tongue of man leſs then his hand: and cloſed it up in his mouth, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him thereby to uſe but few words, and many deeds, ſpeak little and do much: and <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>in the multitude of words there wanteth not ſin.</hi> Prov. <hi>10.19. Emyſſen</hi> ſaith: <hi>there is as much difference between ſaying and doing, as between leaves and fruit:</hi> He that <hi>ſayes</hi> onely, is like the Figtree in the Goſpel, which brought forth leaves only: He that <hi>doth</hi> alſo, is like <hi>Aarons</hi> rod which brought forth bloſſoms and Almonds: Bloſſoms as leaves, and Almonds as fruits: that man only knoweth to ſpeak well, that hath learnt to do well. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mentioneth three Tongues which are in
<pb facs="tcp:61756:6"/> every well dispoſed man. <hi>1.</hi> The tongue of the heart; <hi>loqui veritatem in corde ſuo;</hi> for a man to ſpeak the truth in his heart. <hi>Pſal. 15.2, 2.</hi> The tongue of the mouth; <hi>non agere dolum in lingua ſua,</hi> ver. <hi>3. 3.</hi> The tongue of our works: <hi>the works which I do,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>they bear witneſs of me,</hi> Joh. <hi>10.25.</hi> God little regardeth words without works; for he is not as <hi>Mercury,</hi> to whom Tongues only are offer'd in Sacrifice: Better it is with the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to do well, then with the <hi>Athenians</hi> to ſpeak well.</p>
            <p>Yet the ſpeaking little, ſo much commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture, is not to be underſtood of few words only, but that we ſhould not ſpeak ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unprofitable words; for in matters of ſpeech, the quality, not the quantity is to be regarded; but the two extreams are to be ſhunned: for too much to play the ſullen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to contribute to familiar diſcourſe in good company, ſeemeth to have a diſtaſt or a diſdain; ſo to talk alwaies, not affording any opportunity to others to ſpeak, ſavoureth of vain glory and vanity;<note place="margin">Multa non multum. Multa di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendo nihil dicunt. <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
               </note> ſo that <hi>Balaams Aſs</hi> ſpake more to the purpoſe then ſuch men do: Speech is often like unto coyn, which paſſeth for currant, not in regard of the mettall only, but of the ſtamp that is ſet upon it.</p>
            <p>Now the deſigne of this Treatiſe which I
<pb facs="tcp:61756:6"/> humbly dedicate to your honours, is to ſet forth the evils of the Tongue, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of ten ſins of the Tongue; to ſhew the nature of thoſe ſins, the ſeveral branches, the miſchiefs, and aggravations of them, with remedyes againſt them, whereunto I have added divers conſiderations, rules, and helps for the government of the tongue, ſhewing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo wherein the right ordering of the Tongue conſiſteth, all which is fitted to the times, as the ingenuous Reader will well diſcern.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> Have made bold to ſend this ſlender Treatiſe into the world, under your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours name and patronage, which I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to do, understanding the goodneſs of your diſpoſitions to be ſuch, that I cannot in the leaſt doubt, but that you will pardon my boldneſs, and cheriſh this ſmall ſpark and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of my unfeigned affection to your Honours. My Lord! Judges and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are fingers of that great hand that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth the world; the Gods of the earth to be diſpenſers of Gods mercy to good men, and executioners of his judgements upon evil-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: Compaſſion is the handle, Juſtice the edge, and Mercy the point of the Magiſtrates ſword: the Magiſtrate is a common ſervant for the common good and wealth of all; and he
<pb facs="tcp:61756:7"/> is a happy man indeed, that liveth leaſt for his own, and moſt for the good of others; it is the right uſe of authority, when Governours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect not their own ends in publique actions, nor wear the ſword of Juſtice in their own ſheath, as I hear your Lordſhip doth not.</p>
               <p>Whereas many in high places make <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> their Gospel, ſtudying Lucian more than the old Teſtament, and <hi>Macchiavel</hi> then the New; your Lordſhip knows that there is no Nobility like to the New-birth in Chriſt, no Beauty like to the beauty of the Daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> who is all glorious within; no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Service of God; no Glory to the Croſs of Chriſt, no Gain like Godlineſs, no Treaſure to that which is laid up in Heaven; no cloathing to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; no Ornament to the ornament of Humility and Meekneſs; no Crown to that of Immortality; no kingdom to the Conqueſt of our Selves; no Learning to the knowledge of Chriſt, no Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to that of the Spirit; no Joy to that of a good conſcience, no Life to a Heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. The Lord grant that you may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes account it to be more honour to you to be a ſervant of God, then a Judge over men; as <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> eſteemed it more honour to be <hi>Membrum Eccleſiae,</hi> then <hi>Caput Imperii,</hi> a Member of the Church of Chriſt, then Lord of the World; and that
<pb facs="tcp:61756:7"/> you may be like unto <hi>Moſes;</hi> who as he plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe of God to the people with the ſword of Juſtice, ſo he pleaded the cauſe of the people to God with the tears of Mercy; for good Governours ſhould have <hi>manus ad clavum, oculos ad aſtra,</hi> their hands at the Stern, and their eyes to Heaven. The Lord continue your Lordſhip long to execute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and juſtice among us, which even the Heathens acknowledge to be <hi>mentem Dei, Harmoniam Caeli, &amp; concordiam mundi;</hi> and enrich you Both with all Heavenly bleſsings: So prayeth (my Lord and Madam)</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61756:30"/> hate: now this ſin raigning and Grace cannot ſtand together; for where it reigneth, it clearly ſheweth the heart to be full of bitterneſs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.14. therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Their mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſs.</hi> As they have gall and bitterneſs in their heart. <hi>Act.</hi> 8 23. ſo they utter it with their mouth as one noteth;<note place="margin">Grynaeus.</note> from that root of bitterneſs that is in their heart, <hi>there is brought forth gall and wormwood by their Tongues,</hi> Deut. 29.18. and were there not ſuch an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of bitterneſs and wormwood, and gall in the heart, it would not thus run out in the tongues of men: <hi>Salvian</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Salvian. <hi>de</hi> gubern. lib. 3.</note> that curſing is made the common weapon of graceleſs men when they are angry, their fierce wrath wiſhing that evil upon another, which becauſe of weakneſs it cannot work.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is directly croſs to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: for our Saviour ſaith, <hi>love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for

                  <p n="3">3. It is contrary to Chriſts exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: now every one would be lookt upon to be a Chriſtian, and a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſts body myſtical; but if it be ſo, let men ſhew it by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to his example, conſidering that the Lord Chriſt did not curſe his enemies, but prayed for them; and we are commanded to imitate his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if we are his people. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61756:36"/> of him that hated him, nor lift up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when evil found his enemy; nor did he ſuffer his mouth to ſin by wiſhing a curſe to his ſoul;</hi> and albeit he had ſtrong incitements to revenge by them that were about him that would have eaten the fleſh of them that did wrong their Maſter, yet he kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from it, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. So <hi>David,</hi> though his enemies rewarded him evil for good; yet ſaith he, <hi>When they were ſick, my clothing was ſackcloth, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled my ſoul with faſting;</hi> they rejoyce at his evil; he mourneth for theirs, and prayes for them in affliction. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.13, 14. He behaved himſelf as though his enemy had been his friend or brother, bowing down heavily as one that mourneth for his Mother; and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.9. when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, his ſervants deſire his leave to take off <hi>Shimeis</hi> head for curſing the King; he harkens not unto them, but looketh to the Lord in it, and commits his cauſe to God: <hi>Let him alone, and let him curſe, for the Lord
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61756:36"/> hath bidden him; it may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction, and requite good for his curſing this day.</hi> ver. 11.12. he will not therefore take vengeance himſelf, nor ſuffer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do it; in this imitate <hi>David:</hi> So we read of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> that he ſtood before the Lord to pray and entreat for thoſe that had abuſed him. Take heed of the Saints ſins, but imitate their Graces.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Come in the ſecond place, to treat of that abominable and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin of the Tongue, the ſin of ſwearing; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſeem Religious, ſometimes are guilty of it, and ſo thereby ſhew their Religion to be but vain. And here in the firſt place I ſhall diſcourſe of common, vain, and raſh ſwearing; a ſin too rife in theſe dayes: men may be guilty hereof,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When upon ſlight occaſions or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61756:39"/> ordinary ſpeech, men break out into oaths, or words of admiration, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Gods name in vain, and abuſing his Titles, as <hi>Lord, God, Jeſus, Chriſt, Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghoſt;</hi> when theſe Titles, or any of them are uſed jdly, irreverently, prophanely, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, or cuſtomarily, upon an ill uſe or an old cuſtom, they are abuſed, and Gods name is prophaned; this is done. 1. In way of admiration, when we hear or ſee any ſtrange thing, to ſay Good Lord, O God, O Chriſt, O Jeſus, Jeſu-God, O Lord, Lord have mercy upon us, what a ſtrange thing is this! what a thing is it! or 2. In way of pitty or commiſeration; as ſuch a man is a poor man, God knoweth; it's in a very poor caſe, or its a hard time the Lord knoweth, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming God, or the titles of God very jdly, and prophanely with an evil mind, or very unconſcionably with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reverence due to the heavenly Majeſty; though this may ſeem a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall matter becauſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61756:39"/> of it, yet it is a very wicked practice, and a manifeſt breach of the third Commandement, and a ſin di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt God, who is of infinite majeſty; therefore the offence againſt him deſerveth infinite puniſhment: for the greater the perſon is againſt whom we offend; the greater is the offence; as to ſpeak evil of any man is a fault, though an inferior; but to ſpeak evil of a Noble-man, or of a King, is a greater offence, and deſerves a far greater puniſhment. None of us all but would take it for a great abuſe and diſgrace to our perſons, if our names ſhould be in every mans mouth taken up, and uſed as by-words in way of admiration or commiſeration upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very light occaſion; and ſhall we think that God doth not hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abuſed, diſgraced, diſhonoured, when his Name and Titles are taken up upon evey toy and trifle that is in our way?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When men make a common pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice of ſwearing; when men wil lay their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61756:40"/> faith and troth, and ſouls to pawn, upon every word almoſt that they ſpeak; and when they buy and ſell, to confirm every word with an oath: many men are ſo accuſtomed to this ſin, that when they ſwear, tell them of it, they will not believe it; they forget it again, and are apt to ſwear they did not ſwear: the <hi>Phariſees</hi> gave liberty upon all occaſions to ſwear in common talk, rather out of cuſtom then conſcience.</p>

                  <p>IN the next place I ſhall lay down the greatneſs and aggravations of this ſin of ordinary ſwearing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a great diſhonour to God, when he is called to witneſs in every poor trifle, which is not worth an oath: it were a great diſhonour to the Kings Majeſty, to be troubled and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed with every ſlight cauſe which the loweſt and meaneſt Officer might determine: and it is a greater diſhonour
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61756:41"/> to the King of Kings and the Lord of all, to be called out of his Heavenly Throne to decide every trivial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on earth: this is to make leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of God, then the <hi>Turks</hi> of their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by whom they will not ſwear lightly and vainly, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome important neceſſity: an oath is an high part of Religious worſhip; it is ſpoken of as the ſumme of Chriſts worſhip, and of the ſervice we muſt perform to him in the dayes of the Goſpel: The worſhip of the converted <hi>Egyptians</hi> is thus expreſſed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Five Cities in the Land of Egypt ſhall in that day ſpeak the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Canaan, and ſwear to the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> This is commanded <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God and ſerve him, and ſwear by his Name,</hi> and therein we acknowledge him to be our Lord, and to have power over us as his creatures and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: it is therefore a ſin of a very high nature for men to ſwear by the name of God in ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61756:42"/> diſcourſe, when they ſcarce think of God, or what they do: Some break out into hideous oaths not fit to be named, as Wounds, Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Art thou a Chriſtian, and makeſt no more account of the Wounds and Blood of thy Saviour? herein thou art worſe then the <hi>Jews</hi> that put the Lord Jeſus to death: they made light of his blood upon earth, but <hi>[Thou]</hi> now he is aſcended into Heaven: they ſhed his blood and wounded him but once, but thou doſt repeat it as oft as thou doſt repeat that oath: they wounded him, but did not own him for their Lord; but thou acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeſt him for thy Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and yet ſpareſt not to wound him, and to prophane his name now he is in Glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is the note of a graceleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for the mark by which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt ſets forth a man truly Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, is that he feareth an oath. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2. he feareth to take it in vain; therefore he that feareth not an oath,

                  <p>Slandering is the blemiſhing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers good name, or the ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another out of envy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:61756:61"/>
                  <p>Now men may be guilty of this ſin divers ways; when men report that which is falſe of their Neighbours, to their diſgrace and dammage: no man but will grant this to be a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: ſome there are, when they have no juſt matter of accuſing others, they will deviſe matter wherewith to ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them: thus the <hi>Jews</hi> conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Jeremiah: Come,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>let us imagine ſome device againſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah, come and let us ſmite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his words.</hi> Jerem. 18.18. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> by the ſpirit of God ſpeaking of <hi>Doeg</hi> that ſlandered him to <hi>Saul,</hi> ſets down his ſin thus: <hi>Thy tongue imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth miſchief, and is like a ſharp razor that cutteth deceitfully: Thou doſt love evil more then good, and lyes more then to ſpeak the truth.</hi> Pſal. 52.2, 3. and he complaineth of his ſlanderous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, praying God to help him. <hi>Hold not thy peace, O God of my praiſe: for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth rf the deceitful are opened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

                  <p n="2">2. Men may be guilty of this ſin, when they ſpeak for the matter that which is truth; yet they wreſt it to another end then it was intended,<note place="margin">Words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, have as another ſound, ſo another ſenſe.</note> ſpoken or acted: <hi>Doeg</hi> reported con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ahimelech,</hi> that which was for the matter true, but reporting it to another end then it was done, the ſcripture calls him a falſe tongue: Thus it is with them that were falſe witneſſes againſt our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, they ſaid, he ſaid, he would deſtroy the Temple, and raiſe it again in three dayes: Now he ſaid, <hi>deſtroy ye this Temple,</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Temple of his body) <hi>and I will raiſe it againe in three dayes.</hi> Joh. 2.19, 21. Of this the Prophet <hi>David</hi> complaineth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.5. <hi>every day they wreſt my words, thetr thoughts are againſt me for evil;</hi> and of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61756:62"/> were thoſe that watcht for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s halting, to make him an offendor in a word: that time ſhall come that ſuch tongues as theſe ſhall be cut out.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Men may be guilty hereof, when unto ſomething that is true, they add ſomething that is falſe; and of their own ſurmiſing, and charge their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with it. Thus it was with <hi>Pauls</hi> accuſers. <hi>Act.</hi> 21.28, 29. they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he had brought <hi>Greeks</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple, becauſe they had ſeen <hi>Trophimus</hi> an <hi>Epheſian</hi> before with him in the City: the Apoſtle did not any ſuch thing, but becauſe they do ſurmiſe ſuch a thing, therefore they lay it to his charge, and ſtirr up the people againg him: thus men become guilty of this ſin, pretending ſome ground why they think ſo, and ſo charge their neighbours with what is falſe, and the product of their ſurmiſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Men are ſlanderers when they ſpeak that which is for the matter true, and yet they ſpeak it not upon
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61756:62"/> right grounds, that they ought to ſpeak it; as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When they ſpeak truth for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet it is to vent their own paſſion, as many times in mens reviling one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and throwing filth in one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers faces, they ſpeak truth, but do not care to do their Neighbour good by it, but ſpeak it in paſſion, not with a ſpirit of love, but on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to diſgrace and vilify them, as when evil Neighbours fall out, they rip up one anothers faults and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and miſcarriages, and call one another by diſgraceful and opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Terms.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When men ſpeak what is to the diſcredit of their Neighbour, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hold on a tale in diſcouſe: Now conſider that Slanderers and Tale-bearers are called in the Original by the ſame word, it being a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thoſe that are given to tale-bearing, not to be guilty of ſlander: The Lord abſolutely requireth, that men ſhould not be given to the ſin of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61756:63"/> tale-bearing, to take away their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours good name. <hi>Thou ſhalt not go up and down as a Tale-bearer among thy people.</hi> Lev. 19.16. where we may take notice that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>[Rakel]</hi> properly ſignifies a Pedlar or petty-Merchant,<note place="margin">

                     </note> that goes up and down the Countrey offering his wares at every mans door, taking up his Wares at one place, and carrying them to another to ſell them: So the tale-bearer catcheth up an evil report of his Neighbour at one place, and is not at reſt till he is at another place to tell it again, offering to vend it at a very low rate to any man that will take it off his hands: and as it is with the Pedlar, ſo long as his Pack is faſt, his Ware is not ſeen, but he opens his Pack, and then it is for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones eye; ſo it is with a tale-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; he readily opens his Pack, and the more ſecret the thing is, the more he deſireth to publiſh it, that it may go for the greater news: The Lord tells the Mountains of <hi>Iſrael; Ye are taken

                  <p n="4">4. When men ſpeak againſt their Neighbours, not unto thoſe that may cover their infirmities with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of love, or do any thing toward the reclaiming them, but unto thoſe that will blaze them abroad to their infamy: it is lawful to ſpeak of mens faults behind their backs, to thoſe that have authority over thoſe of whom we ſpeak; this is no backbiting: thoſe that were of the houſe of <hi>Cloe</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto <hi>Paul</hi> the contentions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions that were among the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11. they do not tell what they hear of them abroad to hurt them, but they tell it to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle who watched over them for the good of their ſouls, and he tells them of it, and gives them good counſel, telling them alſo whence he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61756:65"/> of this their miſcarriage, and this he doth for their good: and they that do otherwiſe, are guilty of theſe ſins before the Lord: Grace will teach, and Religion will command a man to ſpeak nothing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ay againſt his neighbour, except unto thoſe that may labour to promote his good: did men make Gods word their rule, much of this Tongue evil might through Gods grace be prevented.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When men ſpeak evil of others (though for the matter true) yet have not their hearts ſo affected with it as they ought; as when a man pleaſeth himſelf with it, and is tickled with delight at it, but hath no bowels of compaſſion towards the body or ſoul of him of whom he ſpeaketh: this is a ſign of a very evil heart: we ought to deal with the ſins of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as with their wounds; not pleaſe our ſelves with them, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them with relenting hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When men ſpeak of the ſins of

                  <p>Yet in ſome (caſes, which being wiſely conſidered) we may ſpeak what we know of others (though it be evil that we know of them) and yet not be guilty of this ſin of ſlandering: as when we are (by ſome that have good ground to enquire after ſuch and ſuch of our neighbours) deſired to relate what we know of them; in ſuch a caſe we may witneſs the truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them before a Mrgiſtrate, or any perſon juſtly deſiring it: or when it is ſo, that our ſilence may be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to deceive others, or prejudice others, we may inform them, leſt their ſpecious pretences of Religion may deceive them: the ſcripture alloweth in ſobriety and moderation, to give an Item to undeceive thoſe that are in danger to be deceived thereby.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Out of a deſire to avenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſuch as have done them wrong, or whom they ſuppoſe to have done them wrong: and when they cannot avenge themſelves otherwiſe, they will ſmite their Neighbour with a ſlanderous tongue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men often ſlander others, out of a deſire of gain to themſelves: thus <hi>Ziba</hi> ſlandered <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> to get his Lands for himſelf: this is very common in Princes Courts; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Diogenes</hi> adviſed the Emperour to take heed of two ſorts of beaſts in his Court, that did bite dangerouſly;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61756:80"/> the tame beaſt, the flatterer; and the wild beaſt, the ſlanderer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Envy is alſo the cauſe of evil ſpeaking. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle would have to be laid aſide; and <hi>ill Will</hi> we ſay, <hi>never ſpeaks good of any;</hi> Men eminent in place or parts, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed; and who can ſtand before envy? herewith the <hi>Jews</hi> being ſtirred up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Stephen,</hi> whoſe wiſdom and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit they were not able to reſiſt, they ſlanderouſly accuſed him as one that had ſpoken evil of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of God. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.8.9.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Pride is alſo the cauſe of evil ſpeaking: pride will ſcarce ſuffer a man to ſpeak well of any; the proud man is apt to detract and ſpeak evil of all others, that he only may be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and applauded.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the ſpecial cauſes why evil men ſlander the people of God, are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The enmity they bear againſt the Image and Graces of God in them, the luſtre of their Holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,

                  <p n="2">2. The wicked ſlander the Godly, to diſcourage them in their profeſſion. A ſlanderous tongue is compared in Scripture to a Razor, to a Sword, to an Arrow; A Razor is keen, it takes off every ſmall hair, a Sword wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at hand, and an Arrow further off; ſo doth an evil tongue.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe they run not with them to the ſame exceſs of riot. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.4.

                  <p>IN the next place I ſhall ſit down the cauſes of this ſin of raſh judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or cenſuring; which are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It proceedeth from a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; for a man that is bad himſelf, and privy to his own naughtineſs, doth eaſily judge others as bad in every kind as himſelf: The moſt vitious are moſt ſuſpicious, and are apt to take all things in the worſt part, whereas <hi>Love thinketh not evil.</hi> 1 Cor. 13.5. when it may have a good meaning: So <hi>Jacob</hi> when his ſons brought <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> coat all imbrued with blood, he knowing it, did not charge them that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61756:140"/> they had murthered their brother, and made him away; but ſaid It is my ſons coat; an evil beaſt hath devoured him, <hi>Joſeph</hi> is ſurely torn in pieces. <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.33.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Pride and an overweening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of a mans ſelf: It was a proud one that ſaid, <hi>I am not as other men are, nor as this Publican</hi> Luk. 18.11. he was high in his own eſteem, when he was far lower in the eyes of God, then he that was deſpiſed by him; he ſet him at nought, as if he were not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to come neer him. When the ſelf-condemning Publican went home to his houſe juſtified rather then the cenſorious and ſelf-conceited <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee:</hi> Some judge raſhly out of pride thinking by how much the more they depreſs the good name of others, by ſo much the more they advance their own reputation, Proud and Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſpirits looking on others with contempt and ſcorn; why elſe do they blaze abroad other mens vices, but to give an occaſion of extolling their falſly ſuppoſed virtues?</p>

                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:61756:141"/>3. A third cauſe of cenſuring is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and uncharitableneſs; how Eagle-ey'd, and ſharp-ſighted are the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> as alſo open-mouth'd, and long-tongu'd concerning the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of others? If they can find no holes in their coats, they will make ſome, as appeareth by their dealing with <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> yea with Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles: <hi>John</hi> is condemned as auſtere, and abſtemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, one that will not keep company, nor partake with them in worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and pleaſures, becauſe ſuch car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages ſuited not with the doctrine of repentance which he preached; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they paſs an uncharitable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon him, and ſay <hi>he hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> Mat. 11.18. On the other ſide our Saviour coming to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt, converſing fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, and keeping company with them that he might convert them, therefore they ſay he is a pot-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and a friend of Publicans and Sinners. <hi>ver.</hi> 19. ſo they deal with

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61756:149"/> ſecret; and hope the beſt in charity, till we know the certainty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us look into our own hearts when we obſerve the temper of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and when we judge them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do it out of good will, or out of ill will: Sometime men have no good will to ſuch a perſon, and that makes them ſpeak ill of them upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſlight occaſion; for malice ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeaks nor thinks the beſt of thoſe that they hate in their heart. Now God forbids the hating of our brother in our heart, and yet are we not to ſee ſin to lye upon him, but to rebuke him, but this rebuke muſt be in love, not in hatred; nor muſt we avenge, nor bear any grudge againſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of our people, but love our neighbour as our ſelves. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17, 18. 1. This will make us mourn for it, that there is ſuch an action in our brother, that we muſt rebuke him for it. 2. It will teach us to carry our ſelves toward others, that we may do them good by our rebukes, by taking
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61756:149"/> the moſt convenient time when it may be moſt for their good, and there may moſt love appear toward them. Thus <hi>Abigail</hi> dealeth with <hi>Nabal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">If he find out a crime, he is not ſo much grieved that it is committed, as glad that he is able to prove it: The thing, ſaith he, that I accuſe him of is true: I therefore do him no wrong to judge him as I do: But that is a falſe conſequence, that he doth him no wrong becauſe the thing is true, for even in truth there may be wrong, as in <hi>Doegs</hi> accuſing, and in <hi>Sauls</hi> judging; in the caſe of <hi>Aheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> relieving <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Doegs</hi> report was true, but maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; therefore he is curſed for it by the ſpirit of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loved evil more then good. <hi>Doegs Hypocr. part.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.</note> ſhe lets him alone in the day of his Wine, becauſe then he was not fit for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, but afterward ſhe tells him the danger he had brought himſelf into: great care ought to be had, when we ſet about ſuch a duty, that they may ſee it is not out of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire we have to reproach them for their ſin, but to bring them to a true ſight of ſin, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for it, that they may turn from their ſin unto God: an erring Brother muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd with the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ſo he may perceive no ill-will in us toward him, but conſcience of duty toward God and love to his ſoul: But when it is ſo, that men reprove others out of ill-will, then that
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61756:150"/> will ſhew it ſelf thus. 1. When a man is glad, that he hath ſome occaſion to cenſure and ſpeak againſt his Brother; and his heart is tickled at it, that he hath an opportunity to cenſure and ſpeak evil of him. 2. When he pries into his Brothers Actions, that ſo he may pick out ſomething againſt him, to ſpeak againſt and cenſure him for: thus the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> watched Chriſt, whether he would heal on the Sabbath day, that they might find an accuſation againſt him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.7. They watched him not out of love to him, but it was a fruit of their malice that they might accuſe him: for St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> went forth, and ſtraight-way took counſell with the <hi>Herodians</hi> againſt him how they might deſtroy him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.9. At other times they put queſtions to him, that ſo they might have occaſion to entangle him in his diſcourſe; therefore we muſt ſeriouſly conſider what our aims are in obſerving the actions of others,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61756:150"/> whether out of love, or out of malice. 3. He that obſerveth his brothers acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of a principle of love to him, will ſo carry himſelf that thereby he may gain his brother; for he aimeth at the good of his ſoul thereby: but when men do it out of ill-will, then they do it not for their brothers good, but that they may thereby bring him to defamation, and get him an ill name by it: let ſuch conſider it, when they proteſt they owe no ill-will to ſuch a man, yet God knoweth it is out of ill-will towards him, that they ſo ſpeak or act againſt him: it behoveth us to conſider what our ends and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are; for God knoweth both, and alſo whether we carry our ſelves to our brethren out of love or hatred. 4. When there are ſome hard thoughts againſt another in our hearts, then the report that we give credit unto at firſt, though it be falſe and appear to be falſe, yet it doth not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily go out of our hearts, but ſtill ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in us againſt our neighbour; and this
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61756:151"/> is cleer, when men are thus haſty in ſnatching an evil report againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is not from good will, but from ill-will.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us obſerve, that there is a great deal of difference between cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of mens perſons and their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: There are three things of men that are ſubject to judgement.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. There is very much unbelief in murmuring; the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured againſt the Lord, and ſhewed their diſtruſt, when they wanted wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaying, <hi>What ſhall we drink?</hi> as though God who had done ſuch great things for them before, could not now have provided them drink? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſaid to tempt the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.2. and therefore the place was called <hi>Maſſah,</hi> and <hi>Meribah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their chiding with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and tempting the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Is the Lord among us?</hi> ver. 7. their unbelief makes

                  <p n="2">2. This ſin ſhews, that mens hearts are more ſet upon other things then God, and the things of God, are ſet up in the place of God: other things are more ſought after for their luſts. <hi>Manna, Angels food, bread from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> is deſpiſed by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> though it be ſuch choice food as it is deſcribed to be. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.24, 25. <hi>It was a ſmall round thing like Coriander-ſeed,

                  <p n="1">1. Be perſwaded to ſit down and conſider what our ſins have deſerved; this will be a ſpecial means to keep us from this ſin: Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſins? it is a murmuring complaint that the Holy-Ghoſt ſpeaks againſt, and ſo it is in the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,

By this means we ſhall be enabled to ſee that there is very much of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the greateſt afflictions that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us in this life: notwithſtanding the affl ctions of the Church (mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the book of the <hi>Lamentations, Chap.</hi> 1, &amp; 2.) were ſo great, that the Prophet could not parallel their caſe with any people under Heaven; yet for all this, ſaith the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61756:165"/> we are not conſumed, becauſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsions fail not. They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulneſs.</hi> She obſerveth much mercy in this ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo that when a man cometh to ſuch a ſight of his ſins as this; when he ſeeth that he hath deſerved nothing but to be caſt out into hell, and to have no other portion; then whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſpenſation he lieth under in this life, he can look upon it (by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace) to be a great mercy. 2. By this means we ſhall come to look upon the leaſt of Gods favours, and highly to prize the leaſt of the mercyes we enjoy: <hi>Ezra</hi> bleſſeth God for that deliverance they had, and that they were eſcaped with their lives; though they were in very great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; yet they ſee what they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and therefore it is they ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prize this deliverance. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13, 15 If you will know what their condition was then, read <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.36.37. <hi>Behold, we are ſervants this day, &amp; for the Land thou gaveſt unto our Fathers, to eat the

Hereby we ſhall come to acknowledge the Lord to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all his wayes, and holy in all his works, in all his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Church calls upon all to take notice of her miſery. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. not to murmure, but to conſider where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord hath afflicted her;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61756:166"/> though her calamity is very great, yet ſhe juſtifieth God, and condemneth her ſelf. <hi>The Lord is righteous, for I have rebelled againſt his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> ver. 18. This will make a ſoul ſilent before the Lord, and not dare to open his mouth againſt him; yea it will enable a man quietly to ſit down under Gods diſpenſatious, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſevere: <hi>If their uncircumciſed hearts be humbled, and they accept of the puniſhment of their ſins, then will I remember my covenant, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Levit. 26.41, 42.</p>

So the many Miracles and Acts that Chriſt did, are ſaid to be more (if they ſhould have been written) then the world could contain the Books that ſhould be written. <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.25.

All parables and ſimilitudes are not lies; Chriſt tells us of the parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> not that there were any two ſuch men, nor any ſuch thing done by them, as is mentioned, <hi>Luk</hi> 16. Yet we ought not to count it a lye, but it is a Similitude, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells us what ſhall become of the rich, if they oppreſs and grind the faces of the poor; and that God will rather accept of a poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> though in rags and miſery, then of a flouriſhing <hi>Dives</hi> cloathed in purple and ſcarlet. The like may be ſaid of Ironies;
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:61756:174"/> ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians: We are fools for Chriſts ſake, but ye are wiſe in Chriſt; we are weak, but ye are ſtrong; ye are honourable, but we are deſpiſed.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.10. Do you think he would tell them they were wiſe, whom a little before he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth for their fooliſhneſs? this is but an Ironical expreſſion: So when a Captain ſhall ſay to his Souldiers, Fight couragiouſly, quit your ſelves like men, the Enemy flies before us; this is but to hearten his own Party to fight the more valiantly; this is very diſputable, whether it be a lye or not: Likewiſe when a Phyſitian hath to deal with a froward and melancholy Patient, he muſt abuſe his judgement, telling the Patient, this and that is for his good, and if he will not take it, he muſt dye: therefore I ſhall not accuſe ſuch a man of a lye.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. There is a direct breach of the ninth commandement, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bear falſe againſt thy neighbour.</hi> 2. Robbery is a breach of the eighth precept; robbing others of their due to whom we are related, and ſo have need of one another. 3. A ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding the ſoul for nothing that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to countervail the loſs of it. 4. Atheiſme; in forgetting Gods All-ſeeing eye, and his ſin-revenging ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:61756:188"/> that he will revenge himſelf of thoſe that rob him of his truth. Now the cauſes and uſual occaſions of this ſin are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A greedy deſire of gain; We ſee that Tradeſ-men for a penny, or a two-penny gain will not ſtick at a lie: Gods command is, that no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud or go beyond his Brother in any thing; and you gain ſomething by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as you think) at the preſent; but you will be loſers by it in the end. <hi>Are there yet the treaſures of wickedneſs in the houſe of the wicked?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have ſpoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth; therefore will I make thee ſick in ſmiting thee,</hi> &amp;c. Micah. 6.10, 11, 12. God may give them leave to get ſome little in the world by it, but he wi l give them much wrath with it hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not only the deſire of gain, but alſo the fear of loſing ſome preſent gain or advantage is the cauſe of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61756:188"/> this made <hi>Gehezi</hi> to belie his Maſter to <hi>Naaman.</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. He co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted Vineyards, Olive-yards, Silver and Gold, and changes of raiment, men-ſervants and women-ſervants, as his Maſter chargeth upon him, and then tells a lie to his Maſter after his return from <hi>Naaman,</hi> ſaying he went nowhither: <hi>Amaziah</hi> chargeth <hi>Amos</hi> falſely to King <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> ſaying, that <hi>Amos</hi> had conſpired againſt him in the midſt of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael. Amos</hi> 7.10. whereas he only prophecyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the houſe of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and ſpake nothing againſt the King. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. But what's the matter with <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Bethel?</hi> oh he ſeeth his gain is going down, if he ſuffer <hi>Amos</hi> any longer to ſhew the people their ſin in worſhipping the golden calves: So they dealt with <hi>Paul</hi> ſtirring up the people againſt him, becauſe he caſt the ſpirit of divination out of the Maid, that brought her Maſter much gain thereby. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. So alſo doth <hi>Demetrius</hi> cauſe a great uproar at
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:61756:189"/> 
                     <hi>Epheſus;</hi> it was gain that made him make ſuch a ſtirre, and to accuſe <hi>Paul</hi> falſely. <hi>Act.</hi> 19.24, 25.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Lying proceeds from envy and malice; when men owe ſuch and ſuch perſons ill-will, they care not what they ſay againſt them: So they that hate Religion, will ſpeak any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Religious: As the Heathen Tyrants did uſe to do with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they cloathed them in the skins of wild Beaſts, that ſo their dogs might be the more hardy to tear them: So do envious perſons deal with thoſe that are Godly, they cloathe and load them with ſcandals, that ſo they may ſet all men againſt them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When men ſuborn perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that are good, that ſo they may get advantage againſt them to put them to death: Thus the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines</hi> and others that disputed with <hi>Stephen,</hi> being unable to reſiſt the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſpirit by which he ſpake; they ſet up falſe witneſſes againſt him, which ſaid, <hi>This man ceaſeth not to

                  <p n="5">5. When men cover their malice againſt Gods people, under pretence of publique good; and thus the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaryes of Gods people write a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letter to King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> againſt them, and ſo cauſed the work of the houſe of God to ceaſe. <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.11, <hi>ad finem,</hi> pretending thereby much good to the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi>

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:61756:212"/> doors of our lips, that we offend not with our tongues! It is a thing praiſe-worthy, in anger to keep our hands from fighting, in abundance of dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty meats to bridle our appetite from intemperance; in great proſperity to refrain from pride; but to offend with the tongue being ſo eaſy, and the way thereof ſo ſlippery, that not to offend in words is a vertue ſo rare, and a thing ſo ſeldom ſeen, as that the ſon of <hi>Syrach</hi> counteth it moſt marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, when he ſaith, <hi>Who is he that faileth not in his tongue?</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> eſteemeth it a great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>If any man offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect man, and able alſo to bridle the whole body.</hi> Jam. 3.2. And to ſhew what great things may be done by the well ordering of the tongue, the Apoſtle compareth it to a Bridle or Bit of an horſe: like as the bit is but a ſmall thing in compariſon of the horſe, yet it turneth about, and ruleth the ſtrongeſt horſe at the pleaſure of the rider; ſo the Tongue
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:61756:213"/> is but a ſmall member in the body of man, yet being moderated with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, it bridleth the whole body. Now that we may the better be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to bridle and moderate our tongues, I ſhall propound theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
               <p>God in his word gives a great charge <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſid. </seg>1</label> to his people that own him for their God, that they look carefully after their tongues: He that leaveth not the eye, the ear, the hand at liberty, he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not the tongue at liberty: A man may not do with his tongue as he pleaſeth. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Solomon</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth, Firſt, <hi>keep thy heart with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,</hi> &amp;c. then the tongue, <hi>Put away from thee a froward mouth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe lips put far from thee;</hi> what is ſpoken there of a perverſe tongue, is meant of all the ſins of the tongue, that have been ſpoken of, and many more that might have been ſpoken to: And ſeeing God doth ſo ſtrictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that we ſhould keep our tongues from evil, and our lips from ſpeaking

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſid. </seg>2</label> doth ſo often repeat his commands for the right ordering the tongue, and his prohibitions againſt the ſins of the tongue. Surely he doth it for theſe ends. 1. That if men be careleſs at one time, they may be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at another; and if they paſs over it in one place of Scripture, they may meet with it in another. 2. Becauſe he knew how careleſs men were apt to be of their tongues, though they were the more careful in other things 3. He knew well the miſchiefs of it, what hurt it would be; therefore he is ſo frequent in commending the duty, like the Maſter of the family, often giving in charge to his ſervants to take heed of fire, becauſe he knoweth the danger of it if it break out. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:61756:214"/> he knoweth what a matter it is to keep the tongue in good order: The Apoſtle ſheweth, that though a ſmall Bit will rule a great Horſe, and a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. It conſiſteth in ſpeaking to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as we ought; when others ſhew their paſsion or malice againſt you in giving you provoking language, then it becomes you to ſhew the truth of your Religion, by your not retorting again: if one caſt dirt in thy face, do not thou caſt dirt in his face: Some will ſay this is hard to fl ſh and blood; but though fleſh and blood cannot bear it, yet grace can: When <hi>Shimei</hi> raileth at <hi>David,</hi> though the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders with the King give him the

In ſo doing we ſhall ſhew our ſelves but like unto them that, revile us; they ſhew themſelves unlike to Chriſtians; and if we do ſo, we ſhall ſhew our ſelves as bad as they are. <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.4. the wiſemans
